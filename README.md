# Rest-Api-IP-Tracker
Rest-Api-IP-Tracker is a web application that leverages the IP Geolocation API by IPify to track and display the geographic location of any given IP address. This project also uses Leaflet, a leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, to visualize the geolocation data on a dynamic map.
